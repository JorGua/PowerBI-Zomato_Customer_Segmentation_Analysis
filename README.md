## Recomendations and Conclusion
- Analyzing the data we figured out there were some errors in the data provided: the orders table is missing the restaurants id (r_id) for a big part of orders, giving an error in the visual top restaurants. The blank data was filtered out. Also the years 2017 and 2020 are missing part of the sales year data which can give discrepancies in the line trends chart.
- Marketing strategies should heavily target students which comprehends more than a 50% of Zomatos's customers and the top spending category by applying discounts, loyalty programs, partnerships with educational institutions, budget-friendly options and promotions to leverage their high spending behavior.
- Create campaigns targeting employees (the second largest customer base 30.4% and the second spending category) with offers on lunch delivery and dinner promotions. Highlight time-saving aspects and convenience to appeal to working professionals.
- Plan marketing campaigns around peak sales periods, such as January and November.
- Create special offers and discounts to boost sales during low periods, like September.
- Due to Zomato's customer base being more than 50% young adults between the ages of 18 and 24, utilize social media and digital marketing channels to reach and engage with younger customers.
- Concentrate marketing efforts on high-performing cities like Tirupati and top performing restaurants like Janta Snacks to capitalizeon existing demand
